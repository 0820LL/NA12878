## Background

We have sequenced the CEPH1463 (NA12878/GM12878, Ceph/Utah pedigree) human genome reference standard on the Oxford Nanopore MinION using 1D ligation kits (450 bp/s) using R9.4 chemistry (FLO-MIN106).

Human genomic DNA from GM12878 human cell line (Ceph/Utah pedigree) was either purchased from Coriell (cat no NA12878) or extracted from the cultured cell line. 
## Data availability

We will start making data publically available from 5pm Eastern on 1st December 2016.
